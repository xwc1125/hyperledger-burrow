- [Natives] Implement Ethereum precompile number 5 - modular exponentiation

`,
		"0.28.2 - 2019-08-21",
		`### Fixed
- [Vent] The new decode event ABI _before_ filter provides more keys but means vent must have access to all possible LogEvent ABIs when it is started. This is not practical in general so we now will will only err if an event matches but we have no ABI. This means we might not notice we have forgot to include an ABI since an event that _would_ have matched on an ABI spec field (prefixed 'Event') will not just not match, and so fail silently.
`,
		"0.28.1 - 2019-08-21",
		`### Fixed
- [Vent] Log for _vent_log insert now faithfully captures what is being inserted
- [Vent] Remove arbitrary 100 character limits on system table text fields

		`### Changed
- [State] IterateStreamEvents now takes inclusive start and end points (end used to be exclusive) avoid bug-prone conversion
- [Dump] Improved structure and API
- [Dump] Default to JSON output and use protobuf for binary output

### Fixed
- [Dump] Fix dump missing events emitted at end height provided
- [Dump] EVM events were not dumped if no height was provided to burrow dump remote commandline
- [RPC/Info] Fix panic in /names and implement properly - now accepts a 'regex' parameter which is a regular expression to match names. Empty for all names.
- [Configure] burrow configure flags --separate-genesis-doc and --pool now work together

### Added
- [State] Burrow now remembers contact ABIs (which describe how to pack bits when calling contracts) - burrow deploy and vent will both use chain-hosted ABI if they are available
- [State] Bond and unbond transactions are now implement to allow validators to transfer native token into validator power.
- [Dump] Better tests, mock, and benchmarks - suitable for profiling IAVL
- [Events] Filters now support OR connective

`,
		"0.27.0 - 2019-06-23",
		`### Added
- [WASM] Support for WASM contracts written in Solidity compiled using solang

### Fixed
-[RPC/Transact] CallCodeSim and CallTxSim were run against uncommitted checker state rather than committed state were all other reads are routed. They were also passed through Transactor for no particularly good reason. This changes them to run against committed DB state and removes the code path through Transactor.

### Changed
- [State] TxExecution's Envelope now stored in state so will be reproduced in Vent Tx tables and over RPC, and so matches TxExecutions served from *Sync rpctransact methods
`,
		"0.26.2 - 2019-06-19",
		`### Fixed
- [Blockchain] Persist LastBlockTime in Blockchain - before this patch LastBlockTime would only be set correctly after the first block had been received after a node is restarted - this can lead to non-determinism in the EVM via the TIMESTAMP opcode that use the LastBlockTime which is itself sourced from Tendermint's block header (from their implementation of BFT time). Implementing no empty blocks made observing this bug more likely by increasing the amount of time spent in a bad state (LastBlockTime is initially set to GenesisTime).
`,
		"0.26.1 - 2019-06-16",
		`### Changed
- [CLI] 'burrow dump' renamed 'burrow dump remote'
- [Consensus] By default Burrow no longer creates empty blocks at the end of a round - though does make on every 5 minutes by default. Set CreateEmptyBlocks to "never" or omit to create no blocks unless there are transactions, or "always" to generate blocks even when there are no transactions.
- [State] Burrow state does not store empty blocks in the execution event store even when Tendermint creates them.
- [Build] 'make install_burrow' is now just 'make install'

### Fixed
- [Deploy] Always read TxExecution exception in Burrow deploy to avoid panics later on
- [Restore] Set restore transaction hash to non-zero (sha256 of original ChainID + Height)
- [Vent] --txs and --blocks now actually enable their respective tables in the Vent database
- [Consensus] Tendermint config CreateEmptyBlocks, CreateEmptyBlocksInterval now work as intended and prevent empty blocks being produced (except when needed for proof purposes) or when the interval expires (when set)

### Added
- [Dump] burrow dump now has local variant that produces a dump directly from a compatible burrow directory rather than over GRPC. If dumping/restoring between state-incompatible versions use burrow dump remote.
`,
		"0.26.0 - 2019-06-14",
		`### Changed
- [Vent] The chain id is stored in the SQL Tables
- [CLI] Command line arguments have changed

### Fixed
- [Tendermint] Disable default Tendermint TxIndexer - for which we have no use but puts extra load on DB
- [Tendermint] The CreateEmptyBlocks and CreateEmptyBlocksInterval now works
- [State] Empty blocks are not longer stored
- [State] Genesis doc is no longer persisted at every block
- [State] Store TxExecutions as single entry per block, rather than one per Event
### Add
- [Vent] vent can restore tables from vent log using new vent restore command
`,
		"0.25.1 - 2019-05-03",

`,
		"0.25.0 - 2019-04-05",

- [CLI] Burrow deploy can now run multiple burrow deploy files (aka playbooks) and run them in parallel
- [Consensus] Now possible to run Burrow without Tendermint in 'NoConsensus' mode by setting Tendermint.Enabled = false  for faster local testing. Execution.TimeoutFactor can be used to control how regularly Burrow commits (and is used

### Fixed
- [Execution] Fixed uint64 underflow (when subtracting fee from balance) not protected against in CallContext

`,
		"0.24.5 - 2019-03-14",
		`### Changed
- [Consensus] Tendermint timeouts configurable by a float factor from defaults and default change to 0.33 of Tendermint's default for smaller networks'
- [Transactor] Hard-coded timeout removed from transactor and added to TxEnvelopeParam for client specified server-side timeout (in case of longer confirmation times such as when some validators are unavailable
- [Logging] ExcludeTrace config inverted to Trace and now defaults to false (i.e. no trace/debug logging). Default log output now excludes Tendermint logging (and is therefore much less talkative)

### Added
- [Logging] Add height to all logging messages
- [RPC] Add LastBlockCommitDuration to SyncInfo

### Fixed
- [Metrics] Replace use of Summary metrics when Histogram was intended
`,
		"0.24.4 - 2019-03-08",

`,

		"0.24.0 - 2019-02-26",
		`### Changed

`,
		"0.23.3 - 2018-12-19",
		`### Fixed
- [State] Since State hash is not unique (i.e if we make no writes) by storing the CommitID by AppHash we can overwrite an older CommitID with a newer one leading us to load the wrong tree version to overwrite in case of loading from a checkpoint.
`,
		"0.23.2 - 2018-12-18",

### Added
- Burrow deploy creates devdoc
- Docker image has org.label-schema labels

- Metrics server does not panic on empty block metas and recovers from other panics
`,
		"0.20.1 - 2018-08-17",
		`### Changed
- The snatives functions have new signatures; string arguments are now string, not byte32.
- The Solidity interface contracts can be generated using the "burrow snatives" command, and the make snatives target is gone.

### Fixed
- TxExecutions that were exceptions (for example those that were REVERTed) will no longer have their events emitted from ExecutionEventsServer.GetEvents. They remain stored in state for the time being.
- CallTxSim and CallCodeSim now take same code path as real transactions (via CallContext)
- Release our mempool signing lock once transactions have been CheckTx'd' to massively increase throughput.

`,
		"0.20.0 - 2018-07-24",
		`This is a major (pre-1.0.0) release that introduces the ability to change the validator set through GovTx, transaction execution history, and fuller GRPC endpoint.

#### Breaking changes
- Address format has been changed (by Tendermint and we have followed suite) - conversion is possible but simpler to regenerated keys
- JSON-RPC interface has been removed
- burrow-client has been removed
- rpc/TM methods for events and broadcast have been removed

#### Features
- Tendermint 0.24.4
- GovTx GRPC service. The validator set can be now be changed.

- Events GRPC service
- Transaction Service can set value transferred

#### Improvements
- The output of "burrow keys export" can be templated

#### Bug fixes
- Fixed panic on nil bounds for blocks service

`,
		"0.19.0 - 2018-06-26",
		`This is a major (pre-1.0.0) release that brings upgrades, safety improvements, cloud configuration, and GRPC endpoints to Burrow.

#### Breaking changes
In addition to breaking changes associated with Tendermint (see their changelog):
- State checkpointing logic has changed which has we load based on blockchain
- Event format has changed over rpc/V0 see execution/events/ package

		"0.18.1",
		`This is a minor release including:
- Introduce InputAccount param for RPC/v0 for integration in JS libs
- Resolve some issues with RPC/tm tests swallowing timeouts and not dealing with reordered events`,
		"0.18.0 - 2018-05-09",
		`This is an extremely large release in terms of lines of code changed addressing several years of technical debt. Despite this efforts were made to maintain external interfaces as much as possible and an extended period of stabilisation has taken place on develop.

A major strand of work has been in condensing previous Monax tooling spread across multiple repos into just two. The Hyperledger Burrow repo and [Bosmarmot](http://github.com/monax/bosmarmot). Burrow is now able to generate chains (replacing 'monax chains make') with 'burrow spec' and 'burrow configure'. Our 'EPM' contract deployment and testing tool, our javascript libraries, compilers, and monax-keys are avaiable in Bosmarmot (the former in the 'bos' tool). Work is underway to pull monax-keys into the Burrow project, and we will continue to make Burrow as self-contained as possible.

#### Features
- Substantial support for latest EVM and solidity 0.4.21+ (missing some opcodes that will be added shortly - see known issues)
- Tendermint 0.18.0
- All signing through monax-keys KeyClient connection (preparation for HSM and GPG based signing daemon)
- Address-based signing (Burrow acts as delegate when you send transact, transactAndHold, send, sendAndHold, and transactNameReg a parameter including input_account (hex address) instead of priv_key.
- Provide sequential signing when using transact family methods (above) - allowing 100s Tx per second with the same input account
- Genesis making, config making, and key generation through 'burrow spec' and 'burrow configure'
- Logging configuration language and text/template for output
- Improved CLI UX and framework (mow.cli)
- Improved configuration


#### Internal Improvements
- Refactored execution and provide interfaces for executor
- Segregate EVM and blockchain state to act as better library
- Panic recovery on TX execution
- Stricter interface boundaries and immutability of core objects by default
- Replace broken BlockCache with universal StateCache that doesn't write directly to DB
- All dependencies upgraded, notably: tendermint/IAVL 0.7.0
- Use Go dep instead of glide
- PubSub event hub with query language
- Heavily optimised logging
- PPROF profiling server option
- Additional tests in multiple packages including v0 RPC and concurrency-focussed test
- Use Tendermint verifier for PrivValidator
- Use monax/relic for project history
- Run bosmarmot integration tests in CI
- Update documentation
- Numerous maintainability, naming, and aesthetic code improvements

#### Bug fixes
- Fix memory leak in BlockCache
- Fix CPU usage in BlockCache
- Fix SIGNEXTEND for negative numbers
- Fix multiple execution level panics
- Make Transactor work during tendermint recheck

#### Known issues
- Documentation rot - some effort has been made to update documentation to represent the current state but in some places it has slipped help can be found (and would be welcomed) on: [Hyperledger Burrow Chat](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow)
- Missing support for: RETURNDATACOPY and RETURNDATASIZE https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/issues/705 (coming very soon)

- Logging sinks and configuration - providing a flexible mechanism for configuring log flows and outputs see [logging section in readme](https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow#logging). Various other logging enhancements.
- Fix event unsubscription
- Remove module-specific versioning
- Rename suicide to selfdestruct
- SNative tweaks

Known issues:

- SELFDESTRUCT opcode causes a panic when an account is removed. A [fix](https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/pull/605) was produced but was [reverted](https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/pull/636) pending investigation of a possible regression.`,

		"0.16.3 - 2017-04-25",
		`This release adds an stop-gap fix to the Transact method so that it never
transfers value with the CallTx is generates.

We hard-code amount = fee so that no value is transferred
regardless of fee sent. This fixes an invalid jump destination error arising
from transferring value to non-payable functions with newer versions of solidity.
By doing this we can resolve some issues with users of the v0 RPC without making
a breaking API change.`,

		"0.16.2 - 2017-04-20",
		`This release finalises our accession to the Hyperledger project and updates our root package namespace to github.com/hyperledger/burrow.

It also includes a bug fix for rpc/V0 so that BroadcastTx can accept any transaction type and various pieces of internal clean-up.`,

		"0.16.1 - 2017-04-04",
		`This release was an internal rename to 'Burrow' with some minor other attendant clean up.`,

		"0.16.0 - 2017-03-01",
		`This is a consolidation release that fixes various bugs and improves elements
of the architecture across the Monax Platform to support a quicker release
cadence.

- [pull-506](https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/pull/506) alignment and consolidation for genesis and config between tooling and chains
- [pull-504](https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/pull/504) relicense eris-db to Apache 2.0
- [pull-500](https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/pull/500) introduce more strongly types secure native contracts
- [pull-499](https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/pull/499) introduce word256 and remove dependency on tendermint/go-common
- [pull-493](https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/pull/493) re-introduce GenesisTime in GenesisDoc

- Logging system overhauled based on the central logging interface of go-kit log. Configuration lacking in this release but should be in 0.16.1. Allows powerful routing, filtering, and output options for better operations and increasing the observability of an eris blockchain. More to follow.
- Genesis making is improved and moved into eris-db.
- Config templating is moved into eris-db for better synchronisation of server config between the consumer of it (eris-db) and the producers of it (eris cli and other tools).
- Some documentation updates in code and in specs.
- [pull-462](https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/pull/499) Makefile added to capture conventions around building and testing and replicate them across different environments such as continuous integration systems.

#### Bugfixes (among others)
